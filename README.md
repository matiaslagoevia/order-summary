## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM

### What I learned

**Mobile vs Desktop Repeating Background Image**
Learning about repeat-x, manually finding where the background would break, and then using a media query to seamlessly switch to the desktop version of the background pattern.

**Background Image and Color combination**
At first I thought this was a SVG pattern or something for the background, but then realized that it was possible to combine the pattern image with a color in a creative and pleasing way.

**Mobile-First Workflow**
Really helped to avoid unnecessarily complicating the CSS and layout. Almost no adjustments were necessary to accommodate for a responsive design this way.

**BEM structure diagram before implementing solution**
Similar to the mobile-first workflow, this helped to have a clear idea of how I'd implement the solution before actually doing so. This helped to work with a purpose and arrive at a cleaner, faster solution.

### Continued development

**HTML and CSS learning paths**
I want to continue expanding my fundamentals as I work on the challenges. I've found a good balance for now of reading about chapters, applying the examples within the reference material, and then solidifying it through Frontend Mentor challenges like this one.

**BEM**
I want to continue developing my intuition and experience with BEM. I've found it to be an incredibly useful mental model and I look forward to continue to use and learn from it!

**Implement actual plan selection/form logic**
This will come with later challenges, though it's something I look forward to. It would be interesting to implement the actual logic and behavior for a system like this, not just the appearance/styles. Still, happy with how this version turned out!
